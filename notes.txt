npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk

After reducer.js

In your React component, you would use useDispatch to dispatch the fetchPosts action,
 and useSelector to select the state you want from the Redux store.

 App.js

 Don't forget to set up your Redux store and apply the thunk middleware.

store.js

Once you've created your Redux store, 
you need to provide it to your React application. 
This is done by using the Provider component from 'react-redux' at the top level of your app.

index.js

The Provider makes the Redux store available to any nested components 
that have been wrapped in the connect() function 
(or use the useDispatch and useSelector hooks as in our example).
